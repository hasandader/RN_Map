This app is built to explain the usage of Maps in React Native.In this app the following was done:
1. Displaying the map,
2. Animate the movement of the map,
3. Give the user ability to select places,
4. Creating a marker,
5. Saving the selected places and display them in another screen,
6. Detecting the user current location.
